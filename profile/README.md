## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the Digital Rosetta Stone Project's GitHub page! Here, you can find our high resolution photographs of the Rosetta Stone that we took in 2018, the raw data of the text alignment in the Ugarit iAligner, the morphosyntactic analysis (= treebanking), and further material of research and documentation.

More about the project offers our [old website (2014-2024)](https://rosetta-stone.dh.uni-leipzig.de/)
and our [new website (2025-)](https://www.digital-rosetta-stone.org/).

Thank you for your interest in ancient languages, Egyptology, and epigraphy!
